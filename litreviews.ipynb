    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**LitReviews**, or LitR *(pronounced lighter)*, is a collection of tools to create an **automated** and **systematic** method of conducting **literature reviews in science**. By using **existing APIs** (application programming interfaces), **graph theory**, and **GPU accelerated processing/visualizations**, LitR will hopefully give the user a sense of what ideas, topics, methods, and funding are currently \"hot\" within a given field of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**PubCrawl**](#PubCrawl) - Uses NCBI E-Utilites via BioPython package to search PubMed and pull metadata. Written in Python 3 and visualized in Cytoscape.\n",
    "2. [**PubCrawlR**](#PubCrawlR) - Future development. Will likely be an extension to PubCrawl which uses R for statistical analyses on metadata.\n",
    "3. [**CrossCheck**](#CrossCheck) - Future development. Citation metadata and funding analyzer using NIH RePORTER (or CrossRef as suggested by Ben Wilks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [works referenced](#Works-Referenced) for information about the original works on which LitR builds upon."

    "\n",
    "### Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "0. Find out what ideas are popular within traumatic brain injury based on the papers the field references. \n",
    "0. Generate a systematic method for exploring these ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Search Pubmed for \"traumatic brain injury\". Yields about ~38,000 records.\n",
    "0. For all ~38k articles, list their references.\n",
    "0. Keep track of references that occur in multiple articles.\n",
    "0. Use graph theory metrics to visualize and calculate metrics for the citation network.\n",
    "    * Positions are determined by spring-electric modelling. Learn more about how the following network graph was made at [cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) and [allegroviva](http://allegroviva.com/allegrolayout2/force-directed-layouts/) (video).\n",
    "    * In short, nodes that are linked together (via citation) are drawn closer together. Otherwise, nodes repel one another.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Shown above is ~15,000 articles (circles/nodes).\n",
    "    * Limited by NCBI FLink output. \n",
    "0. Although links are not shown, the network below is completely connected (i.e. if you place your finger on one node, it is possible to trace a path to another node).\n",
    "0. Size = Citation count\n",
    "    * e.g., The largest node was cited by 395 TBI articles from the original search term.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using graph theory to determine potentially interesting articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Red = Stress. \n",
    "    * \"Stress is calculated by measuring the number of shortest paths passing through a node.\"\n",
    "    * \"The stress of a node in a [network]...can indicate the relevance of [that node] as functionally capable of holding together communicating nodes.\" Definition slightly reworded by me. Please read original paper linked below.\n",
