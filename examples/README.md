## Data

The data are all provided by the PubMed API.
A python program (written by Ade for his broader work on this subject) creates a CSV file collecting metadata for all articles that match a given keyword (Title, PubMed ID, Authors, Date, Language, etc...).

The next program converts the data from the CSV file into a SQLite database.
